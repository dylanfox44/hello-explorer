    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p1>
      The Earth is like that friend who promises to clean up, but then leaves their socks all over the floor, and the socks are actually entire ecosystems. It’s been spinning for billions of years, yet somehow it still can’t manage to get its weather together. Every time you think you have a perfect vacation plan, Earth throws in a random storm just to remind you who’s in charge.
